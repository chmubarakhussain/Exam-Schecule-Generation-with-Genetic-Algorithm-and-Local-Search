# Exam-Schecule-Generation-with-Genetic-Algorithm-and-Local-Search
Manually generating a Mid-term exam schedule for NUCES-FAST is an involved task as a diverse set of  constraints must be enforced while creating the schedule. In this assignment we are going to test the  famous natured inspired Genetic Algorithm combined with local search for solving the scheduling  problem.
